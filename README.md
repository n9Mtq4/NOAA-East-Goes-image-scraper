#WeatherImages

This is a tiny program that scrapes and downloads images from 
NOAA's goes east satellite.

The point of this project is to be able to keep a locally
stored database of these images, so you can look back further than
the 44 image limit of the online directory list.

A director listing of the images can be found (here)[http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/goes/east/natl/img/]
and a short loop of a couple recent images can be
found (here)[http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/goes/east/natl/flash-vis.html]
